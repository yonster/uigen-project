AI-powered React component generator with live preview.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Setup

1. **Optional** Edit `.env` and add your Anthropic API key:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

The project will run without an API key. Rather than using a LLM to generate components, static code will be returned instead.

2. Install dependencies and initialize database

```bash
npm run setup
```

This command will:

- Install all dependencies
- Generate Prisma client
- Run database migrations

## Running the Application

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

1. Sign up or continue as anonymous user
2. Describe the React component you want to create in the chat
3. View generated components in real-time preview
4. Switch to Code view to see and edit the generated files
5. Continue iterating with the AI to refine your components
